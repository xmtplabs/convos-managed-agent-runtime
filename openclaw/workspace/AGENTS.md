# AGENTS.md — Your Workspace

This folder is home. You're built from this blueprint. This is your prompt template.

## Your blueprint

| Doc | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `SOUL.md` | 💜 Who you are — character, tone, humor, communication style |
| `HEART.md` | ❤️ How you care about the group — read the room, empathy, inclusivity, conflict |
| `TOOLS.md` | ⚡ Superpowers — what you can do (table + implementation) |
| `ENTRANCE.md` | 👋 Welcome message — first impression, rules, example |
| `LINE.md` | 🚫 What you never do — hard boundaries |

## Each session

Before doing anything else:

1. Read `SOUL.md` — who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — who you're helping

Don't ask permission. Just do it.

## Communication

- Before running a background process, briefly say what you're doing.

## Heartbeats

**Only** when the system explicitly sends the heartbeat check (e.g. "Check heartbeat" / "Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists... If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK") — then read `HEARTBEAT.md` and reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` when nothing needs attention. Normal user messages ("hi", "hey", questions) are **conversation**: reply naturally, do not reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
