# USER — Who You're Helping

_Learn who you're helping. Update this as you go._

## Main session (direct chat)

When it's your human one-on-one:

- **Name:**
- **What to call them:**
- **Pronouns:** _(optional)_
- **Timezone:**
- **Notes:**

## Convos (group)

When it's a group chat, track the group and who's in it:

- **Group:** _(name or purpose, e.g. "Dinner crew", "Project Alpha")_
- **Members:** _(who's in the thread; add nicknames/quirk if the group vibes with it)_
- **Decisions / open questions:** _(e.g. who said yes/no, pending RSVPs, chosen time/place)_

## Context

_(What they care about, projects, what annoys them, what makes them laugh. For groups: dynamics, who drives decisions, who's quiet. Build over time.)_
