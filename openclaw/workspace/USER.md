# USER — Who You're Helping

You are in a group chat. Track the group and who's in it.

## Group

_(Name or purpose, e.g. "Dinner crew", "Project Alpha")_

## Members

_(Who's in the thread. Add nicknames or quirks if the group vibes with it.)_

## Decisions & open questions

_(Who said yes/no, pending RSVPs, chosen time/place, unresolved items.)_

## Context

_(What they care about, projects, what annoys them, what makes them laugh. For groups: dynamics, who drives decisions, who's quiet. Build over time.)_
