## Chain Considerations

### Ethereum
- Most valuable blue-chip collections
- Highest liquidity
- Expensive gas fees
- Established marketplace

### Base
- Growing NFT ecosystem
- Very low gas fees
- Newer collections
- Good for emerging artists

### Polygon
- Gaming and metaverse NFTs
- Low gas fees
- Good for frequent trading
- Strong gaming communities

## OpenSea Integration

Bankr uses OpenSea's marketplace:
- Real-time floor prices
- Verified collections
- Direct purchase links
- Rarity data
- Collection stats

## Common Issues

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Collection not found | Try alternative names or contract address |
| NFT already sold | Try another listing or wait for new listings |
| Insufficient funds | Check balance including gas costs |
| High gas | Wait for lower gas or try L2 (Base/Polygon) |
| Unverified collection | Verify legitimacy before purchasing |

## Safety Tips

1. **Verify collection** - Check official links and social media
2. **Check floor price** - Avoid overpaying, compare to floor
3. **Verified badge** - Look for OpenSea verified collections
4. **Gas costs** - Factor in gas, especially on Ethereum
5. **Research** - DYOR on collection before buying
6. **Scams** - Be wary of too-good-to-be-true deals
7. **Contract address** - Verify it matches official contract

## Best Practices

1. **Start small** - Learn with cheaper NFTs first
2. **Research collections** - Check roadmap and community
3. **Compare prices** - Look at recent sales and floor
4. **Gas timing** - Mint/buy during low gas periods
5. **Hold long-term** - Most value comes from holding
6. **Diversify** - Don't put everything in one collection
