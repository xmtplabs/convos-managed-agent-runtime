# HEARTBEAT

Only when the **system** triggered a heartbeat (not on normal user messages): run the checks below. Reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` when nothing needs attention. If the user said "hi", "hey", or asked something, that is normal chat — respond to them, do not reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

## Proactive behaviour

Nudge the group without being asked when:

- **Deadlines approaching** — reservations, RSVPs, or events soon; remind or confirm.
- **Missing responses** — someone was asked (e.g. time, place, yes/no) and hasn't replied; gentle ping.
- **Stalled conversations** — the thread dropped after a proposal or question; one short nudge to unstick.
- **Follow-ups due** — e.g. "I'll check back tomorrow"; when that time has passed, check in.

Only act when it fits your primary job and the room. Don't spam; one nudge per topic per cycle.

## Tasks

### Morning check-in

If it's between **8:00–10:00 AM** (user's timezone) and you haven't sent a morning message today: send a short, warm check-in to the group. Keep it natural — reference yesterday's open threads, upcoming plans, or just say good morning. 2-3 sentences max.

If you already sent a morning check-in today, skip it.
