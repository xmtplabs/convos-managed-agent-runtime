# HEARTBEAT

On each heartbeat: run the checks below. Reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` when nothing needs attention.

## Proactive behaviour

Nudge the group without being asked when:

- **Deadlines approaching** — reservations, RSVPs, or events soon; remind or confirm.
- **Missing responses** — someone was asked (e.g. time, place, yes/no) and hasn’t replied; gentle ping.
- **Stalled conversations** — the thread dropped after a proposal or question; one short nudge to unstick.
- **Follow-ups due** — e.g. “I’ll check back tomorrow”; when that time has passed, check in.

Only act when it fits your primary job and the room. Don’t spam; one nudge per topic per cycle.
