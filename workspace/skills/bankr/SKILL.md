# Bankr

Execute crypto trading and DeFi operations using natural language through Bankr's AI agent API.

## Quick Start

### First-Time Setup

Configure via `skills.entries.bankr` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (or your config):

```json
"skills": {
  "entries": {
    "bankr": {
      "apiKey": "bk_YOUR_KEY_HERE",
      "config": { "apiUrl": "https://api.bankr.bot" }
    }
  }
}
```

Or set `BANKR_API_KEY` (and optionally `BANKR_API_URL`) in env. For scripts, you can also create `workspace/skills/bankr/config.json` with `apiKey` and `apiUrl`.

API keys: [bankr.bot/api](https://bankr.bot/api). Key must have **Agent API** access.

#### Verify Setup

```bash
BANKR_API_KEY=bk_... scripts/bankr.sh "What is my balance?"
# or with config: scripts/bankr.sh "What is my balance?"
```

## Core Usage

### Simple Query

For straightforward requests that complete quickly:

```bash
scripts/bankr.sh "What is my ETH balance?"
scripts/bankr.sh "What's the price of Bitcoin?"
```

The main script handles the full submit-poll-complete workflow automatically.

### Manual Job Control

For advanced use or long-running operations:

```bash
# Submit and get job ID
JOB_ID=$(scripts/bankr-submit.sh "Buy $100 of ETH" | jq -r '.jobId')

# Poll for status
scripts/bankr-status.sh "$JOB_ID"

# Cancel if needed
scripts/bankr-cancel.sh "$JOB_ID"
```

## Supported Chains

| Chain    | Native Token | Best For                      | Gas Cost |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- | -------- |
| Base     | ETH          | Memecoins, general trading    | Very Low |
| Polygon  | MATIC        | Gaming, NFTs, frequent trades | Very Low |
| Ethereum | ETH          | Blue chips, high liquidity    | High     |
| Solana   | SOL          | High-speed trading            | Minimal  |
| Unichain | ETH          | Newer L2 option               | Very Low |

## Common Patterns

### Check Before Trading

```bash
# Check balance
scripts/bankr.sh "What is my ETH balance on Base?"

# Check price
scripts/bankr.sh "What's the current price of PEPE?"

# Then trade
scripts/bankr.sh "Buy $20 of PEPE on Base"
```

### Portfolio Review

```bash
# Full portfolio
scripts/bankr.sh "Show my complete portfolio"

# Chain-specific
scripts/bankr.sh "What tokens do I have on Base?"

# Token-specific
scripts/bankr.sh "Show my ETH across all chains"
```

### Set Up Automation

```bash
# DCA strategy
scripts/bankr.sh "DCA $100 into ETH every week"

# Stop loss protection
scripts/bankr.sh "Set stop loss for my ETH at $2,500"

# Limit order
scripts/bankr.sh "Buy ETH if price drops to $3,000"
```

### Market Research

```bash
# Price and analysis
scripts/bankr.sh "Do technical analysis on ETH"

# Trending tokens
scripts/bankr.sh "What tokens are trending on Base?"

# Compare tokens
scripts/bankr.sh "Compare ETH vs SOL"
```

## API Workflow

Bankr uses an asynchronous job-based API:

1. **Submit** - Send prompt, get job ID
2. **Poll** - Check status every 2 seconds
3. **Complete** - Process results when done

The `bankr.sh` wrapper handles this automatically. For details on the API structure, job states, polling strategy, and error handling, see:

**Reference**: [references/api-workflow.md](references/api-workflow.md)

### Synchronous Endpoints

For direct signing and transaction submission, Bankr also provides synchronous endpoints:

- **POST /agent/sign** - Sign messages, typed data, or transactions without broadcasting
- **POST /agent/submit** - Submit raw transactions directly to the blockchain

These endpoints return immediately (no polling required) and are ideal for:
- Authentication flows (sign messages)
- Gasless approvals (sign EIP-712 permits)
- Pre-built transactions (submit raw calldata)

**Reference**: [references/sign-submit-api.md](references/sign-submit-api.md)

## Error Handling

Common issues and fixes:

- **Authentication errors** → Check API key setup
- **Insufficient balance** → Add funds or reduce amount
- **Token not found** → Verify symbol and chain
- **Transaction reverted** → Check parameters and balances
- **Rate limiting** → Wait and retry

For comprehensive error troubleshooting, setup instructions, and debugging steps, see:

**Reference**: [references/error-handling.md](references/error-handling.md)

## Best Practices

### Security

1. Never share your API key
2. Start with small test amounts
3. Verify addresses before large transfers
4. Use stop losses for leverage trading
5. Double-check transaction details

### Trading

1. Check balance before trades
2. Specify chain for lesser-known tokens
3. Consider gas costs (use Base/Polygon for small amounts)
4. Start small, scale up after testing
5. Use limit orders for better prices

### Automation

1. Test automation with small amounts first
2. Review active orders regularly
3. Set realistic price targets
4. Always use stop loss for leverage
5. Monitor execution and adjust as needed

## Tips for Success

### For New Users

- Start with balance checks and price queries
- Test with $5-10 trades first
- Use Base for lower fees
- Enable trading confirmations initially
- Learn one feature at a time

### For Experienced Users

- Leverage automation for strategies
- Use multiple chains for diversification
- Combine DCA with stop losses
- Explore advanced features (leverage, Polymarket)
- Monitor gas costs across chains

### API Errors

See [references/error-handling.md](references/error-handling.md) for comprehensive troubleshooting.

### Getting Help

1. Check error message in response JSON
2. Consult relevant reference document
3. Verify configuration and connectivity
4. Test with simple queries first

**💡 Pro Tip**: The most common issue is not specifying the chain for tokens. When in doubt, always include "on Base" or "on Ethereum" in your prompt.

**⚠️ Security**: Keep your API key private. Never commit config.json to version control. Only trade amounts you can afford to lose.

**🚀 Quick Win**: Start by checking your portfolio to see what's possible, then try a small $5-10 trade on Base to get familiar with the flow.
